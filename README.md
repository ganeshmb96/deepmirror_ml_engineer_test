# deepmirror_ml_engineer_test
This repository contains all my work done for the coding task. The task is as follows

***The Task***

The sales team have been asked by a potential client to benchmark the performance of the DeepMirror platform compared to supervised graph neural networks, transformer models, and classical tree models. The potential client is interested in predicting Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion (ADME) properties of small molecules. There is some publicity available data on ADME properties from the Therapeutics Data Commons (TDC) that can be used for the benchmark. You have recently joined DeepMirror to help build machine learning pipelines and benchmark various models. Your first job will be to create a simple pipeline to benchmark a supervised graph neural network, a classical tree model, and a transformer model using ADME data from the TDC. The client was unclear about the metric used for the benchmark and which specific dataset to use. It is your job to select the dataset and choose an appropriate benchmark metric to help the sales team close the deal.

***Requirements***

- Train a supervised graph neural network, a tree model and a transformer model
- Choose a dataset(s) from the TDC to train the models with
- Benchmark the performance of the models and choose an appropriate metric to compare them
- Summarise your findings in a format that can be clearly understood by the sales team
